How do I approach designing software?
-------------------------------------
- My approach to designing software stems first from reviewing the requirements for that software. Starting with the base code, I develop software to reflect the expected outcome. This requirement analysis also includes analyzing the time needed to develop the software and the libraries needed to compile it. Prior to this class, I had no experiennce with OpenGL and at the beginning, creating the final 3D Scene seemed like a monumental task. I attempted to make my scene as accurate of possible to the original picture while ensuring I met all the requirements for the project. Breaking the scene down by milestones helped me build upon the scene each week which made it easier to tackle the final scene since many initial parts of it were already set up, such as lighting and camera movement. 

How do I approach developing programs?
--------------------------------------
- Developing programs I use many outside resources and videos to walk me through the development process pertaining to things I don't understand. Throughout this project, I utilized YouTube and other OpenGL sources to assist in set up and implementation of the objects. My appraoch to developing code has drstically changed in this course. I became more and more aware of the amount of time one portion of the project was taking me and made me reach for resources I may have not otherwise used. The debugging process taught me a lot about the program and about how to navigate errors without having to totally start from scratch and rebuild over and over again.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
------------------------------------------------------
- The way I see computational graphics and visualization affecting my future career and educational pathways is by using it to manipulate graphics and images if I was developing an application that required graphics. Having the requisite knowledge gained in this class will help propel me into better software and program development that is all encompassing.
